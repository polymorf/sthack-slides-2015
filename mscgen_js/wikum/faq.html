                <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
                <section>
                    <h2>Online interpreter</h2>
                    <h3>Internet explorer support?</h3>
                    <p>
                        No, although in IE10 and up things appear to be working.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In our stats we see the majority of our visitors use chrome and
                        firefox and - to a fare lesser extent - safari. The number of visitors
                        using IE in the last <em>year</em> equaled two, one of them us wanting
                        to confirm stats work in IE....
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, it seems there's no big demand for it. However, if supporting IE
                        would be a piece of cake we would consider it. It is not.
                        IE9 and lower don't support scalable vector graphics. IE10 does, in
                        a way that is probably correct, but which is also a little off from how chrome,
                        firefox, safari and even opera are doing it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the practical side, we do not have direct access to machines running
                        windows 7 (needed for IE10 &amp; higher) either.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Opera support?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yep. The one visitor using Opera can now enjoy the interpreter as well.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Are you going to support styles/ skins?</h3>
                    <p>
                        No.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Rendering differences between mscgen_js and mscgen?</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are a few differences in how mscgen_js renders charts
                        as compared to mscgen. Some of them are technologically based, 
                        some personally.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Entities have a box rendered around them (in mscgen they don't)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Text in entities automatically wraps (in mscgen only when explicitly
                                forced with \n - but then again, in mscgen it generally doesn't have to fit in
                                a box)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                mscgen_js uses 9pt Helvetica (with the browser's idea of 9pt sans-serif
                                as fall back), mscgen uses something else.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                self refering arcs are not rendered as elipses
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                mscgen_js renders arrows on skewed lines at their angle as compared to
                                the arc (mscgen always angles them to a horizontal line)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                mscgen places a self refering arcs either on the right or on the left
                                side, mscgen_js always places it on the right
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Links in the svg are real links (in mscgen they're just blue; links are in a
                                separate ismap)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                ids get rendered as small text in square brackets instead of as superscript
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                mscgen_js does not generated imagemaps (ismap) and 
                                encapsulated postscript (eps).
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Language features</h2>
                    <h3>I'd like to see feature x in Mscgen, could you implement this?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mscgen_js is created to follow the mscgen standard, not the other way 'round.
                        Mscgen was created by and is maintained by
                        <a href="http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/index.html">Mike McTernan</a>, not by me.

                        Suggestions for MsGenny and XÃ¹ are welcome, however.

                        Firstly: thanks for wanting to share this with us!

                                the github repository. You'll need an account on github to do that, however
                                and you might not have one. So you can also try to ...

                            <li>

                                Lastly, if you're handy with javascript: create a fork of the
                                <a href="https://github.com/sverweij/mscgen_js">source</a> on
                                github, fix it and create a pull request. Be sure to understand that - if

                    <p>
                        We're sorry. That shouldn't have happened. However, I'm happy you're taking
                        the time to tell me - see <a href="#improve-mscgen_js">I've found a way mscgen_js can be improved. What do I do?</a>

                    <p>
                        If you have a spontaneous urge to send us  money: don't. We're not doing this
